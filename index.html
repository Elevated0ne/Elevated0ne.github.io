        <p class="extra-text">me when the 69th yuri manga: (because i kinda read like 100 of the oneshots from dynasty reader of touhou)
        <br> this time, it is on an island, with 2 girls, and, a lot of twists (really now, that's a pun, since the story got the twisters, like, winds thingy)
        <br> i don't wanna spoil, but since idc, i'll say that i wanna know what the heck is the monster and what it does with abalones<br>
        oh, and it seems like it got licensed, my take is that i'll have to read it somewhere else, but no matter, i'll read the author's 2 other works as well first</p>

        although, adding more feels quite tiring, since i haven't even finished most of the ongoing series<br>
        btw, mangadex doesn't have the entire translation, but bato.to does anyways, so i'll resort to it then</p>

        <br> 1/5/2007: (wow happy birthday to me) after finishing 400 chapters i have to say, the content conclude in romance and comedy, majority is short light hearted stories (with the exception of a horror one, for whatever reason), the onces that caught my attention:

        <br> The premise here is quite simple, guy do this guy do that, but there's plenty to uncover and in the end, it's alright
        <br> Notably mentioned as pretty, i suppose so <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mangacoloring/comments/16xd914/this_manga_is_just_too_pretty_saihate_ni_madou/" target="_blank">my guy</a></p>

        <br> Anyways, it was alright, art's good and cute, music is normal, story seems quite short but I suppose the world building is there
    <br> Btw, it is gay, like the 3rd time i'd put gay stuff here bruv</p>

        <p class="extra-text">An absolute warcrime of a romcom (which led to its end i presume), there was some potential in a story about a guy aggressively cleaning a "defenseless" gal's absurdly messy house, however some unnecessary appendix really ended that.
          <br>On a side note, though, the endless chapter 8 is a pretty funny concept (perchance it is connected to haruhi's endless 8? lol)</p>

        <p class="extra-text">Now that i'd read this twice (to be fair, it's short af, it's the same length as shokuryou jinrui), i can say with confidence i don't understand what the hell were they fucking around in there, sure, it's somewhat nihilism, trans men, meaning in life, but then, it really is meaning less, isn't it? Because the characters end up dead anyways.<br>
        But again, perhaps that same meaning is what we need to figure out for ourselves, either way, it was real boring to read, the world was dying anyways, there is no way out of the apocalypse, it was, from the very start, the end <br>
        To be fair, it's not supposed to be a normal manga, is it?</p>
