          <br> Looks like mangadex has been changed a bit, so many of those links might not perform well, i won't be dealing with

        <br> The character in this manga is also thought of like, a dog (i never realized that, mostly because it's just
        his personality, and not appearance)
        <br> There is another guy who is like a dog, too, hakuya, however, since he is already engaged to kobeni, it is not my

        <p class="extra-text">Reading this manga up to the point where i can see aqua brute force his mom's phone password, i 
        browsed it and saw extra stories translated by fans, basically, the password that ai used had relations to 
        b-komachi's members, which exposes more of ai hoshino's personality, her situation and her past.
        <br> 
          <br>If i were to give a little summary, I'd say that she got abused by mom: glass shards in rice bowl, and that has
          a connection to when she answered fans: what food do you dislike, something like that, and she replied rice. The
          b-komachi's member knew she ate rice and bento stuff, so why hate it? It was the connection to her being abused by mom.
        <br>
          <br> Ai lied, she couldn't show her weakness, but that question and moment was the only time she was shown like that.
          Poor Ai. Reading this myself, I know I did a terrible job just parroting what people said, but if you got interested, 
          follow <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OshiNoKo/comments/12qbq0z/oshi_no_ko_short_story_45510/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=OshiNoKo" target="_blank">this reddit thread</a>
        <br>
          <br> To be fair, her phone password 45510 was a small detail that even people who read the whole manga went to reddit
          in order to figure out why, and from it i found 2 stories. To think that of all the mangas I have read, there must 
          have been so many missed details sucks. I can deal with it if it's lost during translation, but things like this, 
          it's a mere number, how could i notice every single one?
        <br>
          <br> After binging it and finishing the whole thing (7/5/2025 ngl i don't wanna bother with spinoffs or anything i
          still gotta finish other series), it was definitely good to read. There was the plot, which got me hooked up, acting,
          though they do cut a lot, but it's okay, they'd shown the good parts, acting, idols, love life, detective and, in the
          near end, pulls out 69 plot twists. 
        <br>
        <br> The annoying thing is that, even though there was annoying stuff going on, it is impossible to entirely pin the
          blame on people, the story tries to give them a backstory that explains why they would act unreasonably. It does
          trick me into thinking the bad guys is not that bad after all, they are still evil, it's just that was backed up
          by their pasts.
        <br>
        <br> Honestly, seeing people talk shit about its ending piss me off, it was a rational course of action, or at least 
          I believe so. But still, even if it was that bad what gives you the power to shit on it so terribly, yet you
          enjoy such obnoxiously braindead pieces like solo leveling (I can't confirm that those guys actually like it, though).
          I would, however, correlate that since humans are a bunch of idiots following others and have 0 valid opinions, their 
          criticism have 0 value (as do mine). Fans in the manga was portrayed to be bad in nature, so they are just backing up 
          the author, lol. (mobs should be gone, stupid pieces of shits that don't know they are merely created by entropy)
        <br>
          <br> Btw, kaguya (in kaguya-sama) did appear as a photographer, you know what it means, the next series would be kaguya
          sama

        wait and tension built up to see what it'll turn out to be like. Honestly, I'll probably forget what happened since they
          mostly did some average lovers' things, and then lesbian sex. 
          <br> Let's just say, the black hair doesn't cook well, is scared of some cicadas/ thunder, which is clich√© (especially
          cicadas since midou kenshirou (from another manga down there) also freaks out when he sees them)
          <br> The release of each chapter takes like 1 month, from september to april (for some reason, february isn't
          included?). It mostly means that i'll have to wait for a month for another chapter (so long).

        <p class="extra-text">This is no new manga, it's been sitting around this archive for a while and i even watched the full
          anime, however, this time i just realized an important thing (because apparently mangadex's translation missed chapter 
          32's 2 pages, so i wanted to find those by resorting to raws)
        <br> When i eventually saw them, they said that mangadex's translation has been wrong, which came as a huge shock (how?!),
          so now i'll read the ones on torrent (the raw site)
        <br> What annoys me is that, they stopped at volume 10, in 2019, yet the manga has 15, so for the last 5 volumes, i'll
          have to deal with mangadex (seemingly faulty)
        <br> I am bothered by the fact that torrent stopped at volume 3, which means that i can't download volume 1 to 9 for 
          some odd reason
        <br> But I really want to read the best version!
        <br> It appears that I have finished downloading from volume 1 to 10, yet the pages 32 and 33 of volume 3 are still 
          missing (what a let down)
        <br> Summary: I went to mangadex, read the manga, realize there are 2 missing pages, went to nyaa.si to find raws that
          might have the missing pages, see the translation that says mangadex is faulty, download those translations, they still 
          have missing pages. Had to learn how to turn .cbz into .pdf, learnt that sumatra (i already have it) can open cbz 
          anyways. Read the converted cbz files (they were in the raws), realize that they aren't too different from mangadex 
          after all, returned to mangadex.
        <br> So i just did a bunch of things around this manga, turns out they were all  <img src="tsissome.png" alt="Me asf">

        Anyways the manga is about mesugakis trying to rizz sensei up (really) while being really bratty and provoking cunny 
          nerves sensory (which is highly present in me)<br>
        We get to see their backgrounds and things going on (albeit seemingly dilettantish), let's hope it grows
          big one day!^^
      <br> 4/5/2025: Actually, the manga ended quite a while ago, i just forgot to move it down here, the ending is alright.
        Usually, you'd expect someone to be chosen, but sensei didn't pick anyone, they'd stay together i guess (personally, 
        it's the best ending, because all mesugakis need to be loved equally (though at some point they just became normal
        tsunderes))</p>

        <br> There isn't a whole lot i can say, the story was short but simple, revolving around friends, band

          <br> Usually there is some deep meaning rooted in those mangas, but i can't seem to wrap my head around

        <p class="extra-text">Now that i'd read this twice (to be fair, it's short af, it's the same length as 
          shokuryou jinrui), i can say with confidence i don't understand what the hell were they fucking around in there, 
          sure, it's somewhat nihilism, trans men, meaning in life, but then, it really is meaningless, isn't it? Because 
          the characters end up dead anyways.<br>
        But again, perhaps that same meaning is what we need to figure out for ourselves, either way, it was real 
          boring to read, the world was dying anyways, there is no way out of the apocalypse, it was, from the very start, 
          the end <br>
        To be fair, it's not supposed to be a normal manga, is it?</p>
